Topic modeling is a “method for finding and tracing clusters of words (called “topics” in shorthand) in large bodies of texts,” and a topic is “a recurring pattern of co-occuring words” (Brett, JDH, 2012). As a form of text mining, topic modeling algorithms can be used to discover themes, patterns, trends, and critical vocabulary that can be used to further theorize or explore a corpus. “A topic model doesn’t just show you what people are writing about...It can also show you how they’re writing” (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012). Thus, topics can help us identify unexpected discourses and critical vocabulary shifts that challenge our assumptions. 

Rather than spend countless hours going over the original text or a collection of journal articles by conducting a close reading, topic modeling is a distant reading approach that allows a researcher to become acquainted with a large corpus in a time-saving manner. However, computational methods such as topic modeling can both obscure and reveal as demonstrated by Blevins’ text analysis of Martha Ballard’s diary. The program is not concerned with the meanings of words, but how the words are being used in the text. There was a discrepancy between the computer program’s tally of deliveries and the historian Ulrich’s delivery tally. As a historian who spent hours studying and conducting a close reading of the text, Ulrich has a better grasp on the overall context than the computer program. However, the program was successful in employing word frequency that revealed anomalies such as Martha Ballard’s shift in the way she refers to her daughter and the general trends of what she was writing about over time (Blevins, personal blog, 2009). It is important to note that topic modeling is a tool for discovery and not necessarily useful as evidence. Researchers must be cautious in trying to “interpret” topics and in how they visually organize topics in relation to each other (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012). 

I decided to apply topic modeling to the journal *American Archivist*, which was first published in 1938. It appeared quarterly until 1998 when it switched to being published biannually. It is the official publication of the Society of American Archivists and covers theories, practice, research, and trends in archival science with a focus in North America. In selecting the data for the corpus, I acquired 5,953 journal articles spanning from 1938-2014 from the JSTOR database and requested the data types XML, n-gram1, n-gram2, and n-gram3. My goal is to find what has been relevant to the field of archival science from 1938 to the present, and I expect to see trends toward documenting underrepresented histories and digitizing the archive. 

For my topic model, I chose to have 35 topics. I was debating between having 30 or 35 topics, but when I changed the number of topics from 35 to 30, some of the important topics disappeared or were scattered into different topics. In choosing 35 topics, the model retained the topics “Community archives,” “Soviet archives,” and “Postmodern archives” which are important trends that I wanted to make sure the topic model represented. If I were to publish this topic model, I would get rid of the six topics that I left unnamed as the articles represented in these topics consisted of indexes, bibliographies, news notes, front matter, or back matter. One of the weaknesses of my topic model is that there are three topics on the Society of American Archivists and three almost identical but slightly varying topics about manuscripts. Since the *American Archivist* is the official publication of the Society of American Archivists, I expected this to be a prominent topic in the journal. The relative narrowness of the field of archival science definitely complicated how the topics were organized as nearly every journal article will mention archive, archivist, manuscript, collection, etc. 

One unexpected trend was the topics “Soviet archives” and “International archives.” Considering that the journal’s focus is primarily in North America, it was surprising to see these topics emerge. As I expected, my topic model did demonstrate the recent trends toward documenting underrepresented histories in the archive and the digitization of the archive. The topic “Digital archives” and “Technology” contained articles about Twitter, GIS, and digital accessibility. The topic “Community archives” included articles about documenting women, people of color, marginalized peoples, and immigrants. The most interesting topic was “Postmodern archives” which featured articles about archival activism, social justice in the archives, and discussion on what the field should look like in the future. My topic model also demonstrated the journal’s focus on archival methods and strategies as revealed by the topics “Archival appraisal,” “Archival organization,” “Archival standards,” “Archival strategies,” and “Photographic preservation.” The journal is also concerned with archives of different scale such as “Business archives,” “Local archives,” and “National archives.” My topic model successfully organized trends in archival science and allows for inquiry concerning the future of the field and what trends we might see in the future.
