# Questions
1. *I'm most nervous about computer programming because I don't have any experience with it.*
2. *I'm excited to learn more about DH, especially since I'm interested in archives and how the digital can help organize information and make it more accessible to the public.*
3. *I do a lot of humanities research, so I wanted to learn how the digital can help explore humanities questions.*

# Digital
- This summer, I watched *Crazy Rich Asians,* and it was great to see an all Asian-American cast as there is not a lot of media representation of minorities.
