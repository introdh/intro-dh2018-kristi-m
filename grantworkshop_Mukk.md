## Thick Mapping Japanese and Japanese-American Internment During World War II

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project:

- Where were the camps and assembly centers located? 
- What were living conditions like for internees? (weather, size of camp, population density, temperature, elevation, rural/urban) 
- What were the demographics of different camps and how did their population numbers change over time? 
- How far were internees displaced from their city of origin? 
- How can archival materials and the lived experience of the internees be incorporated with mapping to create a critical spatial narrative? 
- How can spatial history (past, present, and future) be spatially visualized? 
- What do these sites that were previously camps look like today and how are they memorialized? How many Japanese-Americans live within the vicinity of these sites today? 

(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the project’s principal activities and its expected results:

On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, declaring much of the West Coast a war zone operating under military rule and paving the way for around 100,000 individuals of Japanese heritage to be incarcerated in concentration camps in 1942. My project will build on Yale’s “Out of the Desert” project by incorporating the practice of thick mapping, outlined in the book *HyperCities* by Todd Presner, David Shephard, and Yoh Kawano. Thick mapping combines computer-based methods for analyzing information with the documentation of lived experience through archival materials and oral histories to create a critical spatial narrative. In this way, GIS technologies, mapping, and spatial visualization can illuminate multiple lived experiences and explore the past, present, and future of a particular space. My data would come from the Japanese American Museum and U.S. Census data, and archival materials and oral histories would come from the Densho Digital Repository. The locations of camps and assembly centers will be mapped, and camp statistics (weather, acreage, population density, temperature, elevation, rural/urban) will be analyzed. The change in camp populations numbers and camp density over time will also be documented, as well as the distance internees were displaced from their cities of origin. I will create a critical spatial narrative by incorporating archival materials and oral histories documenting the lived experience of the internees. The spatial history (past, present, and future) of the space will be analyzed by exploring what these camp sites look like today and how they have been memorialized, and what this history means for the future of the space and its inhabitants.
