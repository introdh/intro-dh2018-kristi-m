## II. Narrative
**A. Enhancing the Humanities**

Japanese internment during World War II is an event in American history that is often overlooked. This project would further contribute to the developing thick mapping method as outlined in *HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities* by Todd Presner, David Shepard, and Yoh Kawano. They define a hypercity as “a real city overlaid with information networks that document the past, catalyze the present, and project future possibilities.” GIS “can be used to richly contextualize digital information, preserve individual memories, and, perhaps most ambitiously, begin to undo historical erasures and silences” (Kawano, *HyperCities*, 2014). Spatial analysis can illuminate these hypercities by allowing quantitative data to interact with humanistic stories. This allows for a kind of “counter-mapping” as GIS technologies can illuminate hidden or often untold narratives that are not privileged in the dominant discourse. 

This project matters because it can be used as an educational resource and tool for individuals to generate their own critical readings of an event in American history that is often overlooked. I envision it being used by American history students, scholars, a general humanities audience, or just ordinary people with an interest in American history or the spatial history around them. This project would also further contribute to the developing thick mapping method because it holds a lot of potential new ways to think about spatial history, mapping, and GIS technologies, and how spatial history has impacted the past, present, and future of the lives of people.

I conceptualize the map to have six different layers addressing different kinds of humanities questions: 

- Where were the camps and assembly centers located? 
- What were living conditions like for internees? 
- What were the demographics and geographic features of different camps, and how did their population numbers change over time? 
- How far were internees displaced from their cities of origin? 
- How can archival materials and the lived experience of the internees be incorporated with mapping to create a critical spatial narrative? 
- How can spatial history (past, present, and future) be visualized? 
- What do these sites look like today and how are they memorialized? 

**Layer 1** will plot the locations of all War Relocation Authority (WRA) camps, Justice Department camps, U.S. army camps, and assembly centers based on this map provided by the National Park Service:

*Source: National Park Service*

Many of these camps were placed on Native American reservations such as the Poston camp, so I would also map the boundaries of Native American reservations. I would also layer individual camp maps as available from various archives such as the Japanese American National Museum and the National Park Service in order to compare the layouts and amenities of various camps.

**Layer 2** will map the displacement of individuals from their cities of origin to the internment camps. I would also like to map the cities on primarily the East Coast where Japanese families relocated in order to avoid internment on the West Coast. I will base my model off of the one below provided by the Orange County Register:

![](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh2018-kristi-m/blob/master/images/PopulationDisplacement.png)
*Source: Orange County Register*

I will also document the population statistics at each camp over time as well as population density based on data from the U.S. Census and the Japanese American Museum—these visualizations will be based off of the Orange County Register timeline and the American Panorama population visualization included below. If I can find statistics about the percentage of American citizens and Japanese citizens at each camp, I will include that as well because the fact that 62% of internees were U.S. citizens is a crucial point.

*Source: American Panorama*

**Layer 3** will document living conditions at each camp and document things such as weather, temperature, elevation, illness, work life, acreage, terrain, elevation, and whether the camp is located in a rural or more urban setting. 

**Layer 4** will include archival materials, primarily from the Densho Digital Repository and the Japanese American National Museum, to document the lived experience of individuals at each camp. The archival materials will include photographs, letters, art, oral histories, newspapers, legal documents, etc. 

**Layer 5** will focus on mapping the present by mapping Instagram and Twitter engagement at the different camp sites to see how they are interacting with the landscape and with any museums and/or memorials available at each location.

![](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh2018-kristi-m/blob/master/images/MappingTwitter.png)

**Layer 6** will focus on mapping the present in order to imagine the future by mapping sites of memorials, monuments, and museums dedicated to Japanese internment. 

![](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh2018-kristi-m/blob/master/images/Memorialization.png)

A lot of these places of commemoration and remembrance were opened or dedicated in recent years, and there has been failure to preserve and memorialize a lot of the camp sites. In mapping the present sites of memorialization, we can ensure that history is not hidden, erased, or forgotten, and we can imagine what the history of these spaces mean for their inhabitants and current Japanese Americans. In reading about the experiences of Twitter users visiting the Manzanar campsite, many said that you really had to use your imagination in order to picture the camp as most of the barracks were gone and only the desert and a few scraps of debris remain. In future iterations of this project, perhaps visual reconstructions could be something to be explored by reconstructing what camp sites looked like through archival maps and photographs. 

**B. Environmental Scan**

Yale University’s “Out of the Desert: Resilience and Memory in Japanese American Internment” is a project that is similar in nature to my project, but it does not use the method of thick mapping, focuses solely on the past, and is missing some crucial pieces of information. One of the preliminary issues with the Yale project would occur in Layer 1 as the project only maps the WRA relocation centers and assembly centers, but does not map any of the Justice Department or U.S. Army camps.

The map from the National Park Service (pictured below) that I would build my project off of is a lot more comprehensive. The Yale map is a bit misleading about the scope and scale of Japanese internment as it makes it seem that there were fewer camps than actually existed.

Some ideas I liked from the Yale project and would like to incorporate into my project with some tweaking are the adding of archival materials to each campsite as well as a general background context about how Japanese internment started and when it ended. I would improve upon Yale’s model of adding archival materials by making the materials easier to search for and making the interface easier to navigate; this could be done by adding searchable keywords and tags to each archival material. I would also improve upon Yale’s model of providing background context by creating a timeline with all the major events from the Pearl Harbor attack to reparations. I also liked how Yale documented the living conditions of each camp, but I would improve upon this model by adding more specific categories such as weather, temperature, elevation, acreage, etc. that could be integrated into a tool that could compare the living conditions of different camp sites. Although Yale’s map focuses entirely on the past, my project would also look to the present and the future thanks to the possibilities thick mapping. People often question why the past matters, and my project will provide students, scholars, or a general humanities audience with the tools necessary to think critically about spatial history and the repercussions it has today and the possibilities of a more socially just future.

The [*HyperCities*](http://www.hypercities.com/) projects that inspired my project design are: [*LA's Historic Filipinotown*](http://www.hypercities.com/?page_id=2#/hi-fi), [*Mapping Twitter in Realtime*](http://www.hypercities.com/?page_id=2#/mapping-twitter-in-realtime), and [*Holocaust Survivor Stories*](http://www.hypercities.com/?page_id=2#/holocaust-survivor-stories). *LA's Historic Filipinotown* and *Holocaust Survivor Stories* model ways to combine quantitative data with personal narratives. *Mappin Twitter in Realtime* inspired my idea for Layer 5 to focus on social media engagement at different camp sites, museums, and memorials. 

**C. History of the Project**

For my Fall 2018 semester of my senior year, I took the class RHCS 279: Introduction to the Digital Humanities with Dr. Lauren Tilton, an Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities at the University of Richmond and Research Fellow at UR’s Digital Scholarship Lab. In this class, we had a section dedicated to learning about spatial history and GIS technologies. Our class also had to create a [StoryMaps project](http://arcg.is/1j4XH0) that investigated each individual’s notion of space and place on the University of Richmond campus. This project inspired my concept of different layers in my map as well as the importance of narratives and critical perspectives of space and place. I presented my NEH grant proposal to the class, and they voted it as one of the top two projects that they would fund in the class. View the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X6LO8pAZxTKa3O-H3gVCq27wlxqcrF8cvoiB8AjgFK0/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_065) here. 

My preliminary research consisted of David Bodenhamer’s “Beyond GIS: Geospatial Technologies and the Future of History.” He argues that we must embrace GIS Science and view GIS as more than just a technological tool, but a science that uses theories and methods of spatial analysis and deep mapping that capture the complexities and contingencies of human experiences and emotions (Bodenhamer, History and GIS, 2013). Another reading that sparked my interest in critical mapping was Jeremy Crampton’s *A Critical Introduction to Cartography and GIS*. He argues that mapping itself is a political act and a reflection of power relations, and that mapping, cartography, and GIS are capable of engaging with critical issues. Although the cartographic discipline tried to become post-political, “mapping practices and discourses are intimately intertwined.” The mapping of the exclusion zone on the West Coast during Japanese internment and the mapping of internment camp boundaries allowed for incarceration based on racial discrimination, but there is an “economy of morality” as maps and GIS can be used for both good or bad purposes (Crampton, Mapping: A Critical Introduction to Cartography and GIS, 2010). Richard White’s “What Is Spatial History” explained how space is itself historical, and spatial relations can help explain historical changes over time (White, Stanford Spatial History Project, 2010). Thick mapping is a way of doing research that can help generate new questions and relationships that would otherwise go unnoticed.

My previous related work is a class project I completed for RHCS 412: Digital Memory and the Archive with Dr. Nicole Maurantonio in which we created a [tour of the history of race and racism at the University of Richmond](https://www.theclio.com/web/tour/summary?id=741). The tour consists of archival materials, oral histories, and pictures meant to encourage tour-goers to think critically about space and place on campus as well as memorialization, architecture, and landscape. 

**D. Work Plan**

The first step would be accumulating data from the U.S. Census, Japanese American National Museum, Densho Digital Repository, and the National Park Service in order to find information about camp locations, population statistics, living conditions, and archival materials. This research and data collection will be delegated to Kristi Mukk to complete in a three-month period. 

The second step would be for Kristi Mukk to collaborate with Justin Madron, who will create the GIS interface necessary to create the six layers of the project and create an interactive map. Layers 1-4 (mapping camp locations, layering individual camp maps, mapping discplacement from cities of origin, population statistics, population density, living conditions, and creating an archival database) will be scheduled to be complete within a five-month period. After Layers 1-4 are completed, they will be reviewed by the advisory board for feedback. 

The third step will be for Kristi Mukk to research the coordinates of places of memorialization such as monuments, museums, and plaques. The interface created for Layer 6 by Justin Madron and Kristi Mukk’s research are to be completed within a three-month period. During this time, edits will also be made to Layers 1-4 based on advisory board feedback. 

The fourth step will be finishing the last layer, Layer 5. Justin Madron will create the interface for mapping Twitter and Instagram in real time, based on the HyperCities model. This will be completed within a two-month period. During this time, Kristi Mukk will also create a timeline of Japanese internment and its effects from the Pearl Harbor attack to present day. 

The sixth step will be an advisory board review of the rough draft of the map and the creation of a project website that will feature the 6-layered interactive map with a timeline of Japanese internment. The project website will also feature a public forum where visitors can submit their stories and feedback. 

Some risks that might delay the scheduled steps would be a lack of information available for some of the camp sites or difficulty creating a 6-layered map as this visualization of thick mapping is a new and developing method. Project development will be overseen by Co-Director Dr. Tilton and our Advisory Board members. The project will also be evaluated by faculty and students in the University of Richmond’s American Studies department, History department, and the Rhetoric & Communications department. 

**E. Final Product and Dissemination**

I envision the project website being used by American history students and teachers, scholars, institutions dedicated to Japanese American history, a general humanities audience, or just ordinary people with an interest in American history or the spatial history around them. The first targeted audience for the project will be the communities that are located near spaces that were previously internment camp sites/processing centers, or museums and memorials that commemorate Japanese American internment. This project will be disseminated to institutions such as the National Park Service, museums, high schools and colleges, Japanese American Citizens League, Japan-America Society, Japanese American Network, National Japanese American Historical Society, and the National Japanese American Memorial Foundation. The completed project will also be submitted for publication in academic journals such as the Journal of Digital Humanities, American Quarterly, and the Japanese Journal of American Studies. Locally, the project will also target the University of Richmond by hosting a CCE Brown Bag discussion and presenting at the Arts & Sciences Symposium. 

The project website will be placed online for open access, but since everyone does not have access to a computer, physical pamphlets will also be created for dissemination at specific sites such as museums and memorials where the internment camps were previously located. To ensure access to individuals with impaired sight, the website will have an audio feature that individuals can click on to hear the descriptions and narratives at each location.
