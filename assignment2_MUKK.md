The cases in the area of law of desegregation in schools are located in the top left, while the cases in the area of law of free exercise of religion are located in the bottom right. It is interesting to note that the Bob Jones University v. United States case is coded under desegregation in schools as it serves as the linchpin between these two areas of the law, and in my opinion, could be coded in both areas.

# Year

The year function shows that most of the cases in both areas of law occurred from around 1960-1980. The cases in the area of desegregation in schools primarily occurred in the ’60s and ‘70s, while the cases in the area of free exercise of religion primarily occurred later in the late ‘70s and ‘80s. Cases differ in how fast they rise to a level of significance as precedent. When Fowler and Jeon compared the rise of Brown v. Board and Roe v. Wade, Brown was a precedent that was legally weak when it was first issued, but strengthened after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its application in the civil rights cases that followed it. The weakness of the precedent of Brown could explain the defense of freedom of religion being used by Christian schools to stall integration such as in Bob Jones v. US. The article says that “barely more than 1% of schools desegregated in 1964,” and the Brown decision did not establish a legal standard to be followed in future cases despite ruling separate but equal schools to be unconstitutional (Fowler and Jeon, Social Networks, 2008). 

# Centrality

The centrality function reveals that the most important cases were Brown v. Board of Education (1953) and Green v. County School Board of New Kent County (1967) for cases in the area of desegregation in schools. Interestingly, there was no central case for the area of free exercise of religion.

# Gatekeeper

The gatekeeper function reveals seven linchpin cases between the two areas of the law, the most important being Bob Jones University v. United States (1982), which has a high degree due to the number of edges connecting the two clusters. 

# Vote

The most important cases found from the centrality function (Brown v. Board and Green v. County) were unanimous decisions. Bob Jones v. US was also not contentious as only one judge disagreed. It is significant that these important cases were not contentious.
