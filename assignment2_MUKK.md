### Network Analysis of U.S. Supreme Court Data: Racial Discrimination in the Name of Religious Freedom

The network is based on Supreme Court data of citations between legal decisions from 1947-2001 and includes over 7,000 cases. For my areas of law, I chose “free exercise of religion” (code 30160) and “desegregation, schools” (code 20050). These areas of law were identified by the Washington University in St. Louis, which assigned each U.S. Supreme Court case to a legal issue. I chose these two areas because of the history of “religious freedom” being used to discriminate against African Americans and resist integration, particularly in Christian schools during the 1970s and 1980s. 

Using this Supreme Court data, I analyzed co-citation networks, which means that two cases are connected by an edge if five or more cases cite the two cases together. We limit the number of cases in this way because otherwise the data would overrepresent the cases that include a lot of citations. The article on “The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent” explaines how the authority and hub scores are context-dependent, and how these values can change depending on how many cases are included in the network. In using citation networks, you must keep in mind the role of context as justices can use citations to support their arguments, point out inconsistencies, or argue against previous opinions. It is easier to identify key authorities and hubs if the network is smaller and less complex (Fowler and Jeon, Social Networks, 2008). Dense networks are rarely useful, and most network algorithms work better when the network is more sparse. However, the act of data-cutting can add bias and uncertainty as you must be careful to not lose information, but still make the network manageable. Edges must be limited to the highest weighted connections. Which edges and nodes you collect can significantly alter centrality scores. You must be aware of the possible biasing effects from data selection and sampling (Weingart, JDH, 2011). 

Networks are a useful way to represent patterns of connection or interactions between different components of a system. The simplicity of networks is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Networks help simply and represent large amounts of information, but in the process of reducing this information to the basics, additional details can be lost. Network visualizations help us identify the most crucial elements of a system by showing centrality, degree, hubs, and clusters (Newman, Networks: An Introduction, 2010). Another advantage of networks is that it can be combined with other methods and visualizations such as mapping, topic models, text reuse, and word frequency to further reveal patterns and contextualize the data. One example of this is Catalono’s “Digitally Analyzing the Uneven Ground: Language Borrowing Among Indian Treaties” in which networks of language borrowing by decade were placed over their geographic coordinates by digitally detecting text reuse over time and across geographic regions (Catalono, Current Research in DH, 2018). However, piling on abstractions such as creating a network out of a topic model can create complications as both of these methodologies operate on different assumptions. Furthermore, placing network maps over geographic maps can also be complicated as “network space rarely corresponds to geographic space” (Weingart, personal blog, 2011). 

Another weakness of network analysis is that it is ill-equipped to deal with multimodal networks, which can be an obstacle for humanities scholars who are often dealing with multiple complex interactions. Another obstacle for humanities scholars is that node types must be concrete and unchanging, and humanistic data is often more open to interpretation and not easily definable. The process of simplifying data focuses on the similarities and regularities than differences and uniqueness. Humanistic data often does not fit neatly into one category or another (Weingart, JDH, 2011).

Network data can be used to identify the most important Supreme Court precedents, as well as aid in the study of the influence of precedent in judicial decision-making. The importance of stare decisis encourages judges to follow past precedent in order to uphold the legitimacy of the federal judiciary and uphold the notion of decision-making being based on “neutral” and “fair” legal principles rather than the personal preferences of individual justices. The article on “The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent” discovered that their authority scores yielded rankings that closely corresponded to the evaluations by legal experts evaluating a case’s importance (Fowler and Jeon, Social Networks, 2008).  

## Network Analysis 

# Issue

The cases in the area of law of desegregation in schools are located in the top left, while the cases in the area of law of free exercise of religion are located in the bottom right. It is interesting to note that the *Bob Jones University v. United States* is coded under desegregation in schools as it serves as a significant gatekeeper between these two areas of the law, and in my opinion, could be coded in both areas.

# Year

The year function shows that most of the cases in both areas of law occurred from around 1960-1980. The cases in the area of desegregation in schools primarily occurred in the ’60s and ‘70s, while the cases in the area of free exercise of religion primarily occurred later in the late ‘70s and ‘80s. Cases differ in how fast they rise to a level of significance as precedent. When Fowler and Jeon compared the rise of *Brown v. Board* and *Roe v. Wade*, *Brown* was a precedent that was legally weak when it was first issued, but strengthened after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its application in the civil rights cases that followed it. The weakness of the precedent of *Brown* could explain the defense of freedom of religion being used by Christian schools to stall integration such as in *Bob Jones v. US*. The article says that “barely more than 1% of schools desegregated in 1964,” and the *Brown* decision did not establish a legal standard to be followed in future cases despite ruling separate but equal schools to be unconstitutional (Fowler and Jeon, Social Networks, 2008). 

# Centrality
![](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh2018-kristi-m/blob/master/images/plot_centrality.png)
The centrality function reveals that the most important cases were *Brown v. Board of Education* (1953) and *Green v. County School Board of New Kent County* (1967) for cases in the area of desegregation in schools. The centrality of the *Brown* decision is not surprising as it is a well-known case among educated Americans, but most laypeople are not familiar with the *Green* decision. Interestingly, there was no central case for the area of free exercise of religion. Further outside research of context and this area of law would need to be studied to explain the data.

# Gatekeeper
![](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh2018-kristi-m/blob/master/images/plot_gatekeeper.png)
The gatekeeper function reveals seven gatekeeper cases between the two areas of the law, the most important being *Bob Jones University v. United States* (1982), which has a high degree due to the number of edges connecting the two clusters. This is consistent with expert legal opinion about the importance of this case as these two areas of the law collide. 

# Vote
![](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh2018-kristi-m/blob/master/images/plot_vote.png)
The most important cases found from the centrality function (*Brown v. Board* and *Green v. County*) were unanimous decisions. *Bob Jones v. US* was also not contentious as only one judge disagreed. It is significant that these important cases were not contentious.
