This week was an unusual week as a lot of my time both in my classes and in my various activities were focused on place-making, community-building, mindfulness, and thinking critically about space and place on campus. This was enhanced by the fact that I was already thinking about assignment 3 for this class and what interesting connections I could make, so I was more aware of my relationship to space and place on campus than usual. One thing I noticed when creating my data was how often I was in my dorm room in North Court and how I only got off-campus twice the entire week to go shopping at Short Pump and to go to CVS. I think most UR students get caught up in the “Richmond Bubble” and do not get off campus often, and most students’ weekly routines do not deviate from a small amount of buildings and locations on campus.

When creating my map, I decided on a street map as my basemap because I liked how clearly the buildings and streets were outlined and the color scheme was not distracting. This basemap was also interesting because it overlaid symbols such as a book over Boatwright Library and an art symbol for the Modlin Center for the Arts. I used stars to designate my data points with the locations of my classes having yellow stars and places where I dance having blue stars. None of the basemaps available included Queally Center, where I had one of my dance performances during the week. I decided to organize my Storymap by activity and designate each entry like a diary by putting the date, time, and location of each activity. 

A lot of the ways that I experienced space this week were more metaphorical than geographical. When dancing, my body functions as a space, and Ngoma African Dance Company often performs in certain racialized spaces that are designated as multicultural and safe spaces (such as performing for MOVE, the Multicultural Overnight Visitation Experience for prospective students of color). For members of Ngoma, the dance studio is a healing space that allows us to destress from our week and build community with other multicultural students in a safe environment. Bodenhamer defines place as “the product of deep contingency and of the human effort to render that experience meaningful in language, art, ritual, and in other ways.” For Ngoma, the dance studio is where we engage with dance as an art and ritual that has been passed down for generations (Bodenhamer, History and GIS, 2013). 

Bodenhamer argues that as GIS begins to fuse with history and the humanities, we must embrace GIS Science and view GIS as more than just a technological tool, but a science that uses theories and methods of spatial analysis and deep mapping that capture the complexities and contingencies of human experiences and emotions. Not everyone at the University of Richmond experiences place in the same way, specifically multicultural and minority students who experience space differently on campus. For example, the historical division of Richmond College and Westhampton College is an example of gendered space that reflects the social values of the University. For Bodenhamer, space and place are “always being constructed through the various contests that occur over power.” Spaces on campus such as the fraternity lodges, sorority cottages, the LGBTQ lounge, the three rooms in dhall, and gender-segregated dorms such as Robins Hall and Dennis Hall reflect how space and social structures are constructed on campus (Bodenhamer, History and GIS, 2013). 

One of my activities for the week was giving a site pitch for my RHCS 412 class, Digital Memory and the Archive, for what sites on campus should be included in a tour on the history of race and racism at the University of Richmond. In mapping this tour, we hope to disrupt the way that others think about space and place on campus. For example, by marking on the campus tour map the estimated spot of a slave burial ground on campus that was uncovered in 1947, we can engage with spatial knowledge production and problematize various power relationships on campus. In thinking about UR’s move from its downtown location to the West End, we can think about how redlining and the categories it applied to designate the working class and people of color aligned with the University of Richmond’s values and ideals for what its student body demographics would be like. A critical spatial analysis of campus can reveal power relations and the particular lived experiences of different students on campus. 

Crampton argues that mapping itself is a political act and a reflection of power relations, and that mapping, cartography, and GIS are capable of engaging with critical issues. Although the cartographic discipline tried to become post-political, “mapping practices and discourses are intimately intertwined.”  Maps have allowed for colonialism, racism, discrimination, and military practices, but there is an “economy of morality” as maps and GIS can be used for both good and bad purposes. Applying a critical and socio-political perspective to GIS and mapping can help bridge the separation from geography. (Crampton, Mapping: A Critical Introduction to Cartography and GIS, 2010).

White highlights the limits of absolute space and how GIS often emphasizes the “given-ness” of space rather than its “constructed-ness.” White asserts that “GIS is itself a representational space, but its user and sometime its creators seem oblivious of its representational aspects.” Throughout time and different cultures, people have conceptualized space in different ways. Space is itself historical, and spatial relations can help explain historical changes over time. Mapping and spatial analysis are a way of doing research that can help generate new questions and relationships that would otherwise go unnoticed, and GIS can help visualize information and spatial patterns (White, Stanford Spatial History Project, 2010).
